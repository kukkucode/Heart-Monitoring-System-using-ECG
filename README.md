# Heart-Monitoring-System-using-ECG
This project will show you, how we can interface AD8232 ECG Sensor with NodeMCU ESP8266 Board and monitor the ECG Waveform on Serial Plotter Screen. Similarly, we can send the ECG  waveform over the IoT Cloud platform and monitor the signal online from any part of the world using  the PC or simply using the Smartphone.
